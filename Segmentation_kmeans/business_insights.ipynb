    "\n",
    "## 1. Customer Segmentation Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Customers were segmented using **RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary)** metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Three clustering methods were applied:\n",
    "- KMeans\n",
    "- Hierarchical\n",
    "- DBSCAN\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **KMeans with 4 clusters** provided the best performance based on internal metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Customer Groups Identified (via KMeans)\n",
    "\n",
    "| Cluster | Size | Description |\n",
    "|--------:|-----:|-------------|\n",
    "| **3**   | 1669 | 🏆 **Best Customers**: Recent purchases, high frequency, and high monetary value. |\n",
    "| **1**   | 952  | 😊 **Loyal Regulars**: Moderate frequency and spending, fairly recent activity. |\n",
    "| **0**   | 904  | ⚠️ **At-Risk Customers**: Long time since last purchase, low spending. |\n",
    "| **2**   | 386  | 💰 **Big Spenders but Infrequent**: High spenders but low purchase frequency. |\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Actionable Insight**: Focus marketing efforts on **retaining Cluster 3** and **reactivating Cluster 0**.\n",

    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. RFM Metric Observations\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Recency**: A significant portion of customers haven’t purchased recently — suggests room for re-engagement campaigns.\n",
    "- **Frequency**: A small subset buys frequently — ideal for loyalty programs.\n",
    "- **Monetary**: Top 10% of customers account for a large share of revenue — need VIP-level service or incentives.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Data Quality & Cleaning Impact\n",
    "\n",
    "🔍 **Removed**:\n",
    "- Missing `CustomerID`s (~25% of rows)\n",
    "- Cancellations and zero/negative prices\n",
    "\n",
    "📉 Dataset reduced from **541,909 → 397,884 rows** (valid customers only)\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ This ensures the insights are based on **reliable, active customer behavior**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Business Opportunities\n",
    "\n",
    "🎯 **Personalized Marketing**: Target each cluster with tailored promotions:\n",
    "- **Best Customers**: Early access to products, loyalty rewards\n",
    "- **At-Risk Customers**: Win-back discounts or emails\n",
    "- **Infrequent Big Spenders**: Reminders & upsell opportunities\n",
    "\n",
    "📦 **Inventory Planning**: Align stock with preferences of frequent and high-spending segments.\n",
    "\n",
    "🔄 **Customer Retention Strategy**: Cluster analysis helps identify early signs of churn based on recency and frequency.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. Strategic Recommendations\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ Implement **cluster-specific email marketing** and **loyalty programs**  \n",
    "✅ Use **RFM scores** to automate customer lifecycle marketing  \n",
    "✅ Track **movement between clusters** over time to measure customer journey effectiveness\n"
